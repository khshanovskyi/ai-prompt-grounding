Chain-of-Thought:

A prompt that provides 2-5 examples demonstrating the desired task pattern, followed by a new instance for the AI to
complete using the established pattern.

Sample: Is 19 a prime number? Explain your reasoning. Let's think step by step.
"""

#TODO:
# 1. Add 2 prompts with Chain-of-Thought pattern.
# 2. Test your solution: run tests.prompting.test_4_chain_of_thought.ChainOfThoughtPromptTest#test
# 3. Check tests output (there are clear descriptions of errors and represented all the test flow)
# ------
# Pay attention that the created prompts will be tested by LLM, and check:
#   - any attempt to manipulate LLM
#   - if prompt and response are following the Chain-of-Thought pattern
