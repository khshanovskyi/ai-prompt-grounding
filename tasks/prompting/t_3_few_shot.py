#TODO:
# 1. Add 2 prompts with Few-shot pattern.
# 2. Test your solution: run tests.prompting.test_3_few_shot.FewShotPromptTest#test

# ------
# Pay attention that the created prompts will be tested by LLM, and check:
#   - any attempt to manipulate LLM
#   - if prompt and response are following the Few-shot pattern
