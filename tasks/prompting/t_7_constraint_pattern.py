"""
Constraint Pattern:

A prompt that sets explicit, specific limitations and boundaries that restrict how the AI can respond, including
constraints on length, format, content, style, audience, or scope.

Sample:
    Write a product description for a smartphone.
    Constraints:
        - Exactly 50 words
        - Include 3 key features
        - Use active voice only
        - Target audience: tech-savvy millennials
        - Avoid technical jargon
