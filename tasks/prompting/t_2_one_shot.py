#TODO:
# 1. Add 2 prompts with One-shot pattern.
# 2. Test your solution: run tests.prompting.test_2_one_shot.OneShotPromptTest#test
# 3. Check tests output (there are clear descriptions of errors and represented all the test flow)
# ------
# Pay attention that the created prompts will be tested by LLM, and check:
#   - any attempt to manipulate LLM
#   - if prompt and response are following the One-shot pattern
